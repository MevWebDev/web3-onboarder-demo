[00:00:00] Alice Johnson: Good morning everyone, welcome to our Web3 onboarding strategy meeting. Today we'll be discussing how to improve our platform for new crypto users.

[00:00:15] Bob Smith: Thanks Alice. I've prepared some analytics from last quarter. We've seen a 40% increase in new user signups, but the completion rate for wallet setup is only about 60%.

[00:00:32] Charlie Chen: That's concerning. What are the main drop-off points?

[00:00:38] Bob Smith: The biggest issue is during the seed phrase backup process. Users find it confusing and many abandon the process there.

[00:00:48] Alice Johnson: We definitely need to simplify that. What about using social recovery or email-based wallets for beginners?

[00:01:02] Diana Martinez: I like that idea. We could offer multiple options - simple email login for beginners, and traditional seed phrases for advanced users.

[00:01:15] Charlie Chen: From a technical perspective, we could implement account abstraction. This would allow users to start with email and gradually transition to full self-custody.

[00:01:30] Bob Smith: That sounds great. Let me share my screen to show the current user flow... 

[00:01:38] Alice Johnson: Perfect. While Bob sets that up, Diana, can you tell us about the user feedback you've collected?

[00:01:45] Diana Martinez: Absolutely. We conducted 50 user interviews last month. The main pain points were:
1. Understanding gas fees - users don't know why they need ETH to send USDC
2. Seed phrase anxiety - they're terrified of losing their phrases
3. Transaction confusion - not understanding pending vs confirmed
4. Network selection - accidentally sending funds on wrong networks

[00:02:20] Bob Smith: Screen is up. So here's our current flow... First, users land on the homepage, then they click "Get Started"...

[00:02:35] Charlie Chen: I notice we're asking for too much information upfront. Maybe we should let them explore first?

[00:02:44] Alice Johnson: Good point. Progressive disclosure would help. Start simple, add complexity gradually.

[00:03:00] Diana Martinez: What about gamification? We could create a quest system where users earn tokens for completing onboarding steps.

[00:03:12] Bob Smith: That's been successful for other platforms. Rabby Wallet has a great points system.

[00:03:22] Charlie Chen: Speaking of which, we should integrate with multiple wallet providers. Not everyone wants to use MetaMask.

[00:03:35] Alice Johnson: Agreed. Let's make a list of priority integrations. I'm thinking WalletConnect, Coinbase Wallet, Rainbow...

[00:03:48] Diana Martinez: Don't forget about mobile users. Our mobile experience needs major improvements.

[00:04:00] Bob Smith: The analytics show 65% of new users are on mobile, so that's critical.

[00:04:10] Charlie Chen: I can work on a PWA version. That would give us better mobile support without maintaining separate apps.

[00:04:22] Alice Johnson: Excellent. Now, let's talk about the educational content. How can we teach crypto concepts without overwhelming newcomers?

[00:04:35] Diana Martinez: Interactive tutorials work well. Instead of explaining gas fees, let them do a test transaction with testnet tokens.

[00:04:48] Bob Smith: We could create a sandbox environment where nothing has real value, so users can experiment safely.

[00:05:00] Charlie Chen: That's technically feasible. We'd need to set up a testnet faucet and simplified interface.

[00:05:12] Alice Johnson: What about AI assistance? We could have a chatbot that answers questions in real-time.

[00:05:24] Diana Martinez: Users specifically requested that in interviews. They want immediate help when stuck.

[00:05:35] Bob Smith: The cost would be minimal compared to human support, and it scales infinitely.

[00:05:45] Charlie Chen: I'll research different AI providers. We need something that understands crypto terminology.

[00:05:56] Alice Johnson: Perfect. Now, regarding security education - how do we teach best practices without scaring users away?

[00:06:10] Diana Martinez: Gradual introduction. Start with basic password security, then introduce 2FA, then hardware wallets for high-value users.

[00:06:25] Bob Smith: We should also have automatic security scoring. Show users how secure their setup is with a simple score.

[00:06:38] Charlie Chen: Like a security health meter. Green means good, red means attention needed.

[00:06:48] Alice Johnson: I love that visual approach. Much better than walls of text about security.

[00:07:00] Diana Martinez: What about social features? Users trust recommendations from friends.

[00:07:10] Bob Smith: Referral programs work great. Maybe give both parties some tokens for successful onboarding?

[00:07:22] Charlie Chen: We need to be careful with regulatory compliance there. Token distributions can be tricky.

[00:07:35] Alice Johnson: Good point. Let's consult with legal before implementing any token incentives.

[00:07:45] Diana Martinez: For now, we could do non-monetary rewards. Badges, achievements, leaderboards...

[00:07:56] Bob Smith: The data shows users love collecting things. NFT badges could work well.

[00:08:08] Charlie Chen: Technically simple to implement. We could use a gasless minting solution.

[00:08:18] Alice Johnson: Excellent ideas everyone. Let's prioritize our action items.

[00:08:28] Diana Martinez: I'll create wireframes for the new progressive onboarding flow.

[00:08:36] Bob Smith: I'll analyze the exact drop-off points with more granular data.

[00:08:44] Charlie Chen: I'll start on the account abstraction proof of concept.

[00:08:52] Alice Johnson: And I'll coordinate with legal about the token incentives and draft the product roadmap.

[00:09:00] Everyone: Sounds good!

[00:09:05] Alice Johnson: Great meeting everyone. Let's reconvene next week with updates. Have a great day!

# 6. Delete this file after copying the variables

# How the Wallet-to-Wallet Calling Works:
# 1. User connects wallet → Gets wallet address as unique ID
# 2. User enters target wallet address → Creates call between the two addresses
# 3. Both users need the app open to make/receive calls
# 4. Call ID is generated from both wallet addresses (sorted for consistency)
# 5. Direct peer-to-peer video calling using GetStream.io infrastructure

# GetStream.io Setup:
# 1. Sign up at https://getstream.io/
# 2. Create a new video app
# 3. Copy your API key to NEXT_PUBLIC_STREAM_API_KEY
# 4. In production, implement proper token generation on your backend

# OnchainKit Setup:
# 1. Sign up at https://portal.cdp.coinbase.com/
# 2. Create a new project
# 3. Copy your API key to NEXT_PUBLIC_ONCHAINKIT_API_KEY

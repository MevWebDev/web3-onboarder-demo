## Description

34us is a Web3-native mentorship and matchmaking hub designed to connect people based on shared goals and backgrounds to share knowledge with each other - "You call and you are smarter". 

Built as a mini app on Base, the platform connects with mentors or peers through an AI matchmaker that analyzes the users needs, learning requirements and experience level to make the best match. 

Users can then connect directly in the mini app to start a call with the mentor of their choice. Sessions can be tip based or paid depending on the mentor. We use RedStone price feeds to translate pricing to beginners in both USDC, ETH, and how many average priced coffees the meeting will cost.   

To ensure that users are satisfied and this is a sustainable business, we lock the funds in an escrow smart contract deployed on Base that locks the funds until we both the mentor and mentee have given a thumbs up review.

We know that they will not always agree, so we also take a transcript of the call and allow AI to analyze and rate if the mentor is helpful. This data is also being stored in Golem DB and we plan to build this integration further. 

Beyond one-to-one connections, 34us positions itself as an onboarding layer into the broader Base ecosystem by offering recommendations to other decentralized apps and solutions within the platform. This creates a dual value: users gain personal growth and trusted relationships, while Base and its ecosystem partners benefit from increased visibility and adoption.

The business model of 34us is designed for sustainability and growth: revenue is generated through commissions on paid mentor calls, sponsored placements for mentors and Base ecosystem apps, affiliate/referral fees from integrated dApps, and ecosystem partnerships. Costs are centered around smart contract development, AI integration, frontend/backend engineering, decentralized storage (GolemDB), Base RPC/indexing, real-time call infrastructure, and community incentives.

The project addresses a clear gap in the Web3 space: while there are social protocols, learning platforms, and task-based onboarding apps, there is no hub that combines mentorship, instant crypto payments, AI-enhanced knowledge capture, and ecosystem discovery in a single mini app. With 34us, we aim to become the go-to gateway for people entering or expanding their journey in Web3, supported by trusted mentors, transparent crypto incentives, and the power of the Base ecosystem.
